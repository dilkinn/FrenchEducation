# Path to "CDI"
CDI is an acronym for Contract Durée Indeterminée. In France, people love acronyms. This one is probably one of the most important ones. It stands for a lifetime contract. Being very attractive, so hard to attain. My intention, was to investigate French higher education system and its relation to the job placement rates within principal domains. And to see in what impact domain of study, university ranking, degree attended affects job placement rates.

My interest in that topic is driven by some French people's idea, that you shouldn't necessarily have a higher education in order to get a nice. 

In this exploratory data analysis, I address following questions:
    - Does studying for longer increases my chances to get a job?
    - Does the university I go can impact my chances to get a job?
    - Does domain/discipline I choose affect my chances to end up being employed?
 
# The Data 
There are two branches of higher education in France. First is European University System, which include Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral studies. Second is "Grandes écoles" system, traditional French higher education. It consists of two years of preparatory classes, followed by Engineering/Management/Law/etc. schools and Doctoral studies. First system is mostly public, whereas second privat.

I analysed the aggregated datasets from governmental French website (https://www.data.gouv.fr/), that summarise information gathered from students, that attain their degrees in public French universities following European University System. Data was collected after 12-18 months and 30-36 months after getting diploma: their job placement rates and salaries were collected. Datasets contain ~2000000 answers from about 60 universities accross France for 2010-2016 years range.

# Conclusion
It seems that studying longer and attaining higher degrees in France don't have a straightforward impact on the job placement rates. And threre are reasons for that, for a person with little experience, employer will have to pay more, if that person holds higher degree. So if he has a choice between Bachelor and Master, he will rather take Bachelor.

High rank universities (top 20) have statistically higher job placement rates compare to all other universities.
