# Path to "CDI"
CDI is an acronym for Contract Durée Indeterminée. In France, people love acronyms. This one is probably one of the most important ones. It stands for a lifetime contract. Being very attractive, so hard to attain. My intention, was to investigate French higher education system and its relation to the job placement rates within principal domains. And to see in what impact domain of study, university ranking, degree attended affects job placement rates.

My interest in that topic is driven by some French people's idea, that you shouldn't necessarily have a higher education in order to get a nice. 

In this exploratory data analysis, I address following questions:
    - Does studying for longer increases my chances to get a job?
    - Does the university I go can impact my chances to get a job?
    - Does domain/discipline I choose affect my chances to end up being employed?
 
# The Data 
There are two branches of higher education in France. First is European University System, which include Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral studies. Second is "Grandes écoles" system, traditional French higher education. It consists of two years of preparatory classes, followed by Engineering/Management/Law/etc. schools and Doctoral studies. First system is mostly public, whereas second is privat.

I analysed the aggregated datasets from governmental French website (https://www.data.gouv.fr/), that summarise information gathered from students, that attain their degrees in public French universities within European University System. Data was collected after 12-18 months and 30-36 months after getting diploma: their job placement rates and salaries were collected. Datasets contain ~2000000 answers from about 60 universities accross France for 2010-2016 years range. As far, as these are aggregated data, weighting of values in respect with answers received are crucial to obtain correct estimations for hypothesis testing.

# Salary
Universities homogeneously distributed across the country.

Dots on the map above represent universities locations, whereas size of those dots correspond to number of students within each of the following domains in descending order:

    1. Law, Economics and Management
    2. Science, Technology and Health 
    3. Social and Humanity Sciences
    4. Teaching
    5. Letters, Languages, Arts
    

It's not fair to compare Bachelors' against Masters' salaries straight after graduation, because Bachelor students would gain 2 years of experience by the time their mates would finish their Master program. However, it's worth noticing, that avarage salaries grow with each higher education step within each domain. Transparent and solid boxplots represent salaries one year and 3 years after graduation, respectively.

# Job placement rates
Let's have a look how job placement rates vary with each degree attained. Although average job placements are quite high, it seems that within each domain, mean values are rather decreasing.

</div>

Let's check that hypothesis.

# Hypothesis testing
### 1st hypothesis
My null hypothesis would be that **higher level of education achieved does not affect chances to get a job**. 

Let's take an example of Science, Technology and Health domain and compare Bachelors and Masters graduates.

| Job type      |   p-value            | Result         |
|---------------|:--------------------:|----------------|
| Any job       | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.76*10^{-5} < 0.05">          | Reject |
| Full-time job | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2.61*10^{-5} < 0.05"> | Reject         |

Those results suggests, any job search in Science, Technology and Health domain should be more successful for Bachelor degree holders.

### 2nd hypothesis
My second question: is studying in high-rank universities affect chances to get a job? So my null hypothesis would be that **studying in high-rank universitites doesn't affect chances to get a job**.

|    | Job type      |   p-value      | Result         |
|----|---------------|:--------------:|----------------|
| Bac   | Any job       | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10^{-11} < 0.05">     | Reject         |
|Bac   | Full-time job | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.76*10^{-11} < 0.05">   | Reject         |
| Mas   | Any job       | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=10^{-17} < 0.05">     | Reject         |
|Mas   | Full-time job | <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=1.76*10^{-15} < 0.05">   | Reject         |

The answer is yes, studying in one of top 20 universities increase graduates' chances to become employed.

# Conclusion
It seems that studying longer and attaining higher degrees in France do not have a straightforward impact on the job placement rates: higher degree one holds, more difficult it become to be that person who received that offer. One of possible reasons could be the higher salary an employer have to pay to an unexperienced worker. 

High-rank universities (top 20) have statistically higher job placement rates compare to all other universities within the same domain. 

### Further investigation

1. Discipline wise salaries
2. Comapre Bachelors salaries in 3 years with Masters in 1 year. Allows to compare correctly.
3. Table with p-values for all domains/disciplines.
