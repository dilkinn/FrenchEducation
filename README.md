# Path to "CDI"
CDI is an acronym for Contract Durée Indeterminée. In France, people love acronyms. This one is probably one of the most important ones. It stands for a lifetime contract. Being very attractive, so hard to attain. My intention, was to investigate French higher education system and its relation to the job placement rates within principal domains. And to see in what impact domain of study, university ranking, degree attended affects job placement rates.
